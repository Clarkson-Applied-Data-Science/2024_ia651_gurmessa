# Predicting wildlife strikes by flight phase.

## ðŸ¦… Problem Statement

Aircraft wildlife strikes are a major safety concern in aviation. This project predicts the most likely animal species involved in a strike based on factors like flight phase, time of day, location, and altitude.

## ðŸ“Œ Approach

- **Data Collection:** The data taken from kaggle. The owner of the data collected this from different aviation centers.
- **Feature Engineering:** Key features include flight phase, altitude, location, and time of day.
- **Model Selection:** To be decided yet.
- **Prediction:** Identifies the species most likely involved in a strike for a given scenario.

## ðŸ›  Installation

To set up the project, install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
